## Git commands
- ```clone```: 
  - Usage: `git clone` is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.<br/>
   `git clone <git-repo-link>` [More about command here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone)
  - Example: `git clone https://github.com/lokeshtejavath/passgen.git`
- ```add```:
  - Usage:The `git add` command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.
  <br/> 
  `git add <directory>` [More about command here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes#:~:text=git%20ignore%20page.-,git%20add,until%20you%20run%20git%20commit%20.)
  - Example: `git add .` -> for whole current working directory

- ```commit```:
